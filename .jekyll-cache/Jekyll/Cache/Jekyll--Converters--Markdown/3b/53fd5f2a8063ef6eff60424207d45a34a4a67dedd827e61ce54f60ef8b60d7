I"š<p>Over the last 12 months, the digital delivery team at Homes England have been supporting the organisation deliver strategic transformation projects as well as support our existing estate of applications. Alongside this core delivery activity, we have also been focused on our own delivery transformation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish a Digital delivery Roadmap</li>
  <li>Reboot our PMO to be optimised for agile delivery</li>
  <li>Prioritise our portfolio and backlog to operate within agreed WIP limits</li>
  <li>Make our work, progress, risks and blockers visible in order to manage flow and risks in real time</li>
  <li>Coordinate and integrate our portfolio with Transformation and the wider business</li>
  <li>Make our delivery management processes transparent to the business and responsive to business needs</li>
  <li>Design and implement a professional DevOps toolchain</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout this process, we have focused on how we can support our colleagues and teams by tuning our processes and ways of working. One aspect of this has been learning and development, and establishing best practice. We tackled this through training, coaching and also collating a body of knowledge in the form of a delivery playbook.</p>

<p>Our aim has always been to reuse what already exists and contribute to the wider community by sharing our outputs and working in the open. We hope this blog can help us achieve that.</p>
