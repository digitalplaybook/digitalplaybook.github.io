I"Q(<p class="govuk-heading-s">Update from Sarah Slack, AD Delivery:</p>

<p>It been another crazy busy week!</p>

<p>Shout out to all of the delivery managers for coming together on Monday at short notice to help put in place the actions needed in response to the 9 point Health and wellbeing action plan. It was a sensible and pragmatic approach to meet the needs of each area of Delivery â€“ thank you.</p>

<p>Project Online chat has ramped up this week  - I have seen some great opportunities to make things lean, simple and to work more in the open. The feedback session with Portfolio and delivery was great to see some really challenging conversations happening in a respectful and honest way.</p>

<p>A few shout outs from me this week go to:</p>

<p>@Chris Nicholson, for embracing new challenges</p>

<p>@Jonathan Widdows for super stakeholder engagement</p>

<p>@Victoria Sherrington for super relationship management with legal</p>

<p>@Ajay Mistry and @Roni Saanumi for the ERP work and delighting our customers ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>There will be a few wellbeing activities going in the diary next week for those that want to join up and an option to just keep the video off if you need to give your eyeballs a rest.</p>

<p class="govuk-heading-s">Data Platform â€“ Martin Ciran</p>
<p>Itâ€™s still early days for our work on the Investment use case, but our data analyst has already produced a first partial data model and has started reconciling the data. The work on the Finance scorecards in Power BI continues. We had a good Show &amp; Tell with the business key stakeholders and collected inputs for our current sprint.
The whole technical team (data and platform engineers and technical architects) had several discussions and workshops on how to best integrate the data pipeline code with the infrastructure one. The integration is a crucial piece of work that will allow us to run the solution from end to end for the first time. Exciting!</p>

<p>We welcome Jez Hart to the team (Business Analyst), to assist with the internal process mapping required as part of the DPIA - our next milestone to complete!

Infrastructure resource lined up for single sign on &amp; HRMIS have populated a sample import template containing test data.

<p class="govuk-heading-s">â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Management Information (MI Suite) â€“ Chris Nicholson</p>
<p>Planning completed for Sprint 7.
Development continues for building the Power BI report for KPI 8 (Low Medium Volume Builders)
Munaf (Performance Team) is making good progress on the MI Intelligence Hub and has been having conversations with Paul Williams to include the MI Suite reports within the DET Intelligence Hub
System Testing is in progress for KPI 4 (Share of funding to the top 50% of LAâ€™s by the price earnings ratio) and is expected to finish this week. Planning has started for making this report live
Analysis work is nearing completion for KPI 9 (MMC reporting). Development work wonâ€™t start on this until there has been agreement on when the remainder of the reports are to be developed and how they will be governed (Release 2)</p>

<p class="govuk-heading-s">Data Protection and Privacy Management â€“ Alpha â€“ Chris Nicholson</p>
<p>Follow-up discussions have been delayed until w/c April 19th with One Trust and Core Stream due to the pause of Digital projects.  InfoSec are included in these meetings as they are interested in the Information Asset and 3rd party risk functionality
Met with the Procurement team to ensure that we are following the right steps for formal procurement, which was very helpful
Attended a meeting with Simon Divine to bring him upto speed on the product to be procured as this will have some implications on support from a Service Desk perspective
Attended a meeting with the Risk team to keep them in the loop with where the project had got to as they have a keen interest in using the same product for Risk Management (currently out of scope)
TDA attendance has been put back until April due to the project pause
No update has been provided yet from the Legal team who are reviewing some of the T&amp;Cs. Given their current workload its likely that they have not started a review and itâ€™s likely to create a delay for Alpha to be finished
Slides are now prepared for the Digital Tuesday Show and Tell on 23rd March</p>
