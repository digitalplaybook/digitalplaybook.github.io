                <p class='govuk-body'>Teams at Homes England are recommended to use an agile approach to project management to build and run government digital services. Agile methods encourage teams to build quickly, test what they’ve built and
                  iterate their work based on regular feedback.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">For an initial understanding of the basics of what Agile is, the Agile Manifesto can be found here: <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/​" class="govuk-link">https://agilemanifesto.org/</a>​ Following on from
                  that, The Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto can be found here: <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" class="govuk-link">https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</a></p>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Scrum</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">Scrum is the most commonly used agile method. It allows a highly structured model with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Scrum is a framework for delivery management that concentrates on teamwork,
                  accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal or Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The framework begins with a simple premise: Start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and tweak as
                  necessary</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Learn more about the features of Scrum in the <a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a>, written by the developers of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.</p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Kanban</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">Kanban as a development method was inspired by production systems that focus on reducing waste and improving quality, like those created by Toyota. Kanban is a way of visualising and improving your current
                  working practices so that work flows through a system quickly.</p>

                  <p class="govuk-body">A fast and smooth flow of work means you can:</p>

                <p class='govuk-body'>All development teams responsible for software development in an agile environment should follow the 7 +/- 2 rule laid down within agile ways of working, with a focus on the following roles​:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>1 x Delivery Manager​ - Responsible for facilitating the team, obtaining resources for it, and protecting it from problems, removing blockers, ensuring the team has what it needs to do its job, coaching the team when necessary
                  </li>
                  <li>1 x Product Manager​ - responsible for the vision, priority order of the backlog and negotiating with the team what order they want to build in, represents the end user and all of their needs</li>

                <p class="govuk-body">​​​​​​​The skills a team will need may change throughout the lifecycle of your service but this is a standard team shape to deliver digital change. Teams may also need SME’s like Architects, Data and
                  Infrastructure engineer, who will support the team where needed.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">​​​​​​​All development teams are to act as self-organising, autonomous teams that develop strong relationships working collaboratively with the wider business units ​.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">​​​​​​​Some larger services will have a Service Owner who is accountable for the quality of a service. They must have the decision-making authority to make changes to a service and drive the vision. Service
                  Owners adopt a portfolio view, managing end-to-end services which often include multiple products and channels.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">​​​​​​​They have overall responsibility for developing, operating and continually improving a service. Product Managers work with Service Owners to ensure Service Teams are delivering changes that move towards
                  the vision of the Service Owner.</p>

                <p>Go through each ticket in flight and get updates on it - close down no longer required tickets (steer from the Product Manager) to ensure that the backlog is as up to date as possible​</p>

                <p>Anyone can put a new item in the backlog but they MUST inform the PM in advance who will then in turn prioritise the item - without that communication and letting everyone add stuff to the Product Backlog often results in reduced
                  transparency, lack of clarity, a wrong ordering and loss of manageability.​</p>

                <p>Ensure by chasing the PM that the backlog is still in relevant priority order. Priorities can be decided on ROI to the organisation, benefits to the customer/end user, technical common sense (build one service/screen) before
                  another - process flows/maps can be a useful visual aid to map the user journeys/data flows and to then write/prioritise user stories against them (that helps decide what order you might consider doing work items in)​</p>

                <p>Stories near to or at the top of the backlog should meet your team’s Definition of Ready ​</p>

                <p>A useful acronym to consider when managing your backlog is <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">DEEP</span>:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Detailed Appropriately</span>. User stories on the product backlog that will be done soon need to be sufficiently well understood that they can be completed in the coming sprint. Stories
                    that will not be developed for a while should be described with less detail.</li>
                  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Estimated</span>. The product backlog is more than a list of all work to be done; it is also a useful planning tool. Because items further down the backlog are not as well understood (yet),
                    the estimates associated with them will be less precise than estimates given items at the top.​</li>
                  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Emergent</span>. A product backlog is not static. It will change over time. As more is learned, user stories on the product backlog will be added, removed, or reprioritised.​</li>
                  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Prioritised</span>. The product backlog should be sorted with the most valuable items at the top and the least valuable at the bottom. By always working in priority order, the team is able
                    to maximise the value of the product or system being developed.​</li>
                </ul>
                ​
                <p>Our backlogs are a statement of intent. They are kept in priority order from 1 at the top to N down the bottom (on a daily, weekly sprintly basis). They can be used to visualise the order in which we want to release our
                  code/services. Start with any deadline dates and reverse engineer to your start date – then start to map out your sprints</p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Roadmap</h3>
                <p>A roadmap is a plan that shows how a product or service is likely to develop to achieve a particular goal.
                </p>
                <p>For service teams this goal will be the vision developed with the Service Owner. Each service or product should have a roadmap maintained by the product manager.
                </p>
                <p>A good roadmap:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Makes it clear what you’re trying to achieve (Vision)</li>
                  <li>Sets out the steps your product will take to get there (iterations)</li>
                  <li>Helps users, development teams and stakeholders understand the outcomes they are likely to see</li>
                  <li>Helps the wider team understand how what they’re working on relates to future priorities</li>
                  <li>Supports conversations to prioritise based on value</li>
                  <li>Is not a promise to deliver; they capture intent and allow for change and regular review as we learn more</li>
                  <li>Helps readers understand what is not being done e.g. if the product delivered in beta will only be usable by 20% of all applications the roadmap is a good place to reflect this outcome</li>
                </ul>

                <p> After committing to building a new service, we need to understand how it will work for users and how it will integrate with existing processes and systems.
                </p>
                <p> Alpha results in a better and more focused service. It allows us to understand how users will interact with the service and what is technically possible.​

                <p> With a clear scope, user needs, and technical approach in place, we are ready to build a working version of the service. This is beta.​
                </p>
                <p> Beta results in software that can handle real transactions and is ready to work at scale. It allows us to develop better services that meet user needs.​

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Live</h3>
                <p> Once a service is being used for real transactions, continuous improvements can be made based on feedback, research and data. This is Live.​
                </p>
                <p> An active digital service is never ‘done’. The live phase allows us to respond to change and new research findings in order to keep iterating the service.​

                <p>The Heads of Profession Community of Practice (CoP) is a self-organising group that spans across departments and professions with members distributed throughout Digital and Transformation.
                </p>


                <p>The purpose of this Head of Professions Community of Practice is to ensure the representation of the different professions that play an important role in the cultivation, delivery and support of digital products and services and to
                  promote best practice across the organisation.
                </p>


                <p>To maintain it's purpose, we start by sharing the agenda and associated packs prior to the meeting so the relevant people can take the action and follow up offline after the initial discussion at HoP.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What are weeknotes?​</h3>

                <p>We use weeknotes to inform the people we’re working with about our progress, issues we’re dealing with, and what we’re planning to do. They can be a really useful way to update people you deal with directly, but they can also be
                  shared more widely with people who are less directly involved in a day to day basis.​
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What makes a good weeknote?​</h3>
                <p>A good weeknote:​</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Sounds like it was written by a human. Ask yourself whether it would be something you’d be happy to receive and read. You don’t need to make it too formal.​</li>
                  <li>Is honest about progress as well as issues. This is a good way to flag things that need to get dealt with on a project.​</li>
                  <li>Gives a sense of what the team is delivering as whole. Don’t just write bullets covering what every individual on the team did that week.​</li>

                </ul>

                <p>We send out weeknotes to update you on progress. Weeknotes highlight things we’re worried about, acknowledge achievements and show progress, and layout what we plan to do next. Along with our show and tells, this is the main way
                  you will find out about the project so please read.​
                </p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Good Things​</h3>

                <p> What are the main highlights this week? Have you hit any milestones, or overcome any significant blockers? What decisions have been made? Do you have any images to show progress? (e.g. a photo from a workshop, or a screenshot of
                  something that’s been built?)​

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Learned things​</h3>

                <p> Have the team learned anything from a retro? Did anything happen that you didn’t expect? Have the team made any changes to how the team operates? Have the team uncovered anything new from user research? Does anyone from the team
                  have any personal reflections that they’d like to share?​

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Difficulties​</h3>

                <p> What challenges or issues does the wider project team need to be aware of? How are you dealing with them? What help do you need - either from within the project team or elsewhere?​

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Achievements​</h3>

                <p> Are there any team achievements that need recognising? Are there any individuals you want to recognise? (they don’t need to be inside the core project team - they could be someone from a different department who helped you out
                  this week).​

                <p> In the UK, at least 1 in 5 people have a long term illness, impairment or disability, and many more have a temporary or situational disability.
                </p>
                <p> Accessibility means making sure services and content can be used and understood by the widest possible audience. As a public sector organisation, we must remove as many barriers or obstacles to accessing our services as possible.
                </p>

                <p> There are people who temporarily do not have use of their senses due to illness or injury - such as having an ear infection, burst eardrum or cold.

                </p>
                <p>And we must consider people who don’t have full use of their senses because of the situation they’re in - such as being in a noisy environment that prevents you being able to hear as clearly. User needs should be considered whether
                  an
                  impairment or disability is permanent, temporary or situational.</p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility and the law</h3>
                <p class="govuk-heading-s">Equality Act 2010 and Disability Discrimination Act 1995</p>
                <p> We have a legal obligation to provide equal access to people with disabilities in the UK and Northern Ireland
                </p>

                <p>In The Equality Act 2010, it says that public authorities must comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty. This means that public organisations, like central and local government, healthcare and education, must think about the
                  needs of people who are disadvantaged or suffer inequality, when they make decisions about how they provide their services and implement policies.</p>


                <p> This means we are obliged to:
                </p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                  <li> Make sure their websites and apps are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust
                  </li>
                  <li> Publish an accessibility statement - this will make clear the level of accessibility across the site or app
                  </li>
                  <li> WCAG is a set of recognised guidelines that can be followed to make components on a website accessible. The guidelines are broken down into three levels.
                  </li>
                  <li> To be compliant with the regulations, we must meet level AA.
                  </li>
                </ul>



                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Understanding WCAG</h4>

                  <li>Level AAA: for sites with the highest (and most complex) level of web accessibility</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are important dates with these regulations.
                </p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Websites published on or after 23 September 2018 already have to be compliant - as of September 2019.</li>
                  <li>Existing websites have to be compliant by 23 September 2020.

                  There are four actions we must should take to make sure our websites and apps are compliant:</p>

                <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li>Understand how we are impacted by the regulations

                  </li>
                </ol>


                <p>Accessibility statements are one of the key requirements of the new regulations. Websites should have their own statements and they must include:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>how accessibility was evaluated</li>

                  <li>how to contact the enforcement body</li>
                  <li>it must be regularly updated as and when you make changes to websites. Or, at least once a year.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Monitoring the regulations</h3>
                <p>The Government Digital Service, or GDS, has a role in making sure compliance with the regulations happens. They monitor and report on the accessibility of public sector websites and mobile apps, and are responsible for enforcing
                  the
                  requirement to publish an accessibility statement. They will also publish their findings.
                </p>

                <p>However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Great Britain and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland will enforce the law.
                </p>
                <p>This means they can use their existing legal powers under the Equality Act 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to launch investigations, issue unlawful act notices and take court action against offending organisations.
                </p>

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How can you help?
                </h4>
                <p>Firstly, I want to touch on document formats. PDFs are one of the most common issues for websites. Any content being published to websites should be published in HTML. PDFs should only be used for printed documents. However, if
                  there
                  are situations when you need to upload a PDF you should publish them as additional documents. HTML should be published by default.
                </p>


                <p>There’s a lot of discussion around PDFs and their accessibility. These documents are created to be printed, so they’re not built to be read on screens. This means they aren’t responsive which can make them challenging to open on
                  mobile and means they aren’t compatible with screen magnification. They aren’t usually structured so can be difficult for screen reader users to navigate.
                </p>


                <p>Using the correct page structures to format your content helps those using screen readers to understand the layout of a document. Each document or page should have one heading, and subheadings can be used to provide a structure to
                  the
                  page or document. You can find and edit the pre-formatted headings and subheadings within the format tab of most programs.
                </p>


                <p>It’s also important that you use a sensible font size. The default paragraph font size is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens.
                </p>


                <p>Link text is a WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. Links must stand out from other text and have a 3:1 colour contrast ratio between them and the surrounding text. Blue is often used as the default because it isn’t hugely affected by green
                  and
                  red colour blindness.
                </p>


                <p>Link text should be meaningful and make sense without the context of surrounding content. This is to make sure it is accessible to users navigating the content with a keyboard instead of a mouse and those using screen readers that
                  pull together a lists of links.
                </p>


                <p>Colour should not be used to convey a key message. This is why you should avoid using pie charts to demonstrate data as it cannot be understood if a user is colour blind.
                </p>


                <p>You must also make sure there is sufficient contrast between the colour of your text and the background it’s on. WCAG guidelines state that you should have a minimum ratio of 4.5:1. There are free online tools that can be used to
                  check the contrast of colours - contrast checker is a common option.
                </p>


                <p>Alt text is used to describe an image. It’s read by software for visually impaired users and displays when an image doesn’t load.
                </p>


                <p> It’s important that you keep alt text short and simple, including only the information the users needs to know about the message the image is conveying. This means you needn’t include things like ‘picture of’ or ‘image of’ </p>
                <p>It’s also
                  important that you add alt text to design elements like buttons when creating marketing emails, for example.
                </p>


                <p>Form image buttons must have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button. Image buttons are often used to provide a more visually appealing or a smaller version of the standard form buttons. The alternative text
                  should
                  describe what the button will do when selected, such as "Search", "Submit", "Register", "Place your order", etc. For instance, <input type="image" alt="Submit Search"> might be appropriate for an image button on a site search form.
                </p>

                <p>You may not have to meet the requirements for your whole website or app if doing so would be a disproportionate burden - for example, if it’s very expensive to make even simple changes and those changes would bring very limited
                  benefits to disabled people.
                  If you’re not sure what would be disproportionate in your situation, talk to your legal adviser.

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Using third party software or outsourcing:
                </h4>
                <p>You’re legally responsible for your website meeting accessibility requirements, even if you’ve outsourced your website to a supplier.

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Internal facing services:
                </h4>
                <p>In a 2017 survey, 9.9% of the civil servants who declared their disability status said they were disabled. It’s crucial that your service is fully accessible.</p>

                <p>The Team Health Check is a self-evaluation tool, a workshop format, to help you improve and become stronger as a team. The goal of the workshop is to increase self-awareness, trigger discussion on how you can improve as a team and
                  how
                  you can be even more successful at collaboratively deliver value to your users and stakeholders.
                </p>


                <p>These take place once a month usually alongside a retro. It focuses on themes rather than specific project issues.</p>



                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits</h4>

                <p>Running a Team Health Check with the teams will:
                </p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>Increase awareness of where the team is at, it’s state, challenges and opportunities
                  </li>
                  <li>Trigger discussions within each team with regards to their current state of health.
                  </li>
                  <li>Generate improvement actions within the team, as any good retrospective.
                  </li>
                  <li>Highlight to leadership how they can support as servant leaders or in which way the can tackle specific challenges across teams
                  </li>
                  <li>Communicates good desired behaviours (such as collaboration, feedback, integrity) as well as what teams should be allowed to expect from the leadership of the organization (support, trust, involvement, connection to purpose and
                    why).</li>
                </ul>



                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Not just for teams</h4>

                <p>Although health checks are primarily used by delivery or operational teams, it can be used by leadership, communities and other Governance or advisory forums. It’s always a good idea to reflect and think about if you are achieving
                  what you set out to do or if/should that change.</p>



                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Voting</h4>

                <p> Each topic comes with two set of examples. If you think the green statement best exemplifies how things are, you vote green. If you think the red statement best exemplifies how things are, you vote red.
                </p>


                <p>If you’ve seen both green and red examples, or believe things are neither green nor red, you vote yellow. Green doesn’t necessarily mean things are perfect, nor does red mean that things are v. bad.
                </p>


                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Topics</h4>

                <p>The health check itself consists of 11 topics. For each topic, there is a green and red statement. The green statement describes a healthy or positive example. The red, an unhealthy or bad example.</p>
