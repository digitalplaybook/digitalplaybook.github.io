<p>Happy Friday!</p>

<p>I kicked the week off attending the inaugural Community of Practise for the Heads of Profession. This will be a real step change in how we have worked and a real opportunity to empower our wider leadership group into making decisions and working collaboratively. This community spans Digital and Transformation and Iâ€™m really excited to see how they will be able to make a real difference with decision making and communication. Rumman Amin has been key in getting this set up so really looking forward to hearing more about the work.</p>

<p>Tuesday saw me taking part in an objective setting workshop as part of the Building brilliant performance workstream. As someone who has worked in a leadership role for over 20 years, I have covered the content many times but it was good to have a refresh and to get a view from colleagues who are relatively new to line management. This is all great preparation for our annual performance review which you should see start to drop in your diary now for April/May and will be the last review of its kind as we get ready to move to the new continuous Performance Management cycle launching shortly (Iâ€™m sure Al can give us a sneak peak ðŸ˜‰)</p>

<p>The contractor renewals are still causing some of my team concern, and being busy chasing approvals, contacting agencies for reassurance and navigating the different processes. If you have any contractor on your team who is still uncertain of their status then please tell them to get in touch with Victoria Sherrington for an update.</p>

<p>I chaired the Portfolio Assurance Board on Thursday which is a real increase in our maturity on both the spend pipeline (thank you Nikki Wilson) and in the level of conversation taking place. This month we took a deep dive into the Cloud Hosting Platform and Brian walked us through a presentation (thanks to Rumman Amin, Justin Hannan, Nikki Wilson and Claire Harrison) for all the contributions on this one) and it was fair to say there were some challenging questions, however, our preparation and research put us in an excellent position for responding and seeking the support for our work. This exercise has given us an opportunity to reflect on lessons learned and the approach we will be taking with all of our Digital Projects.</p>

<p>Next week Hot topics for me include: Project online with Victoria Sherrington and Richard Yeboah, Product Professional communications with Alan Johnston and most importantly, trying to cram 5 days of work into 4 as its Good Friday next week.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="monitor--jonathan-widdows">Monitor â€“ Jonathan Widdows</h3>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="data-platform--martin-ciran">Data Platform â€“ Martin Ciran</h3>

<p>A new deployment pipeline has been born this week! This new addition is responsible for deploying the Data pipeline onto the infrastructure. This is really exciting as we are very close now to testing the service end-to-end i.e. the infrastructure together with the data pipeline and the Power BI visualisations. Upcoming days will be dedicated to fine tuning the deployment process and running end-to-end tests
Visuals for the Finance scorecards are almost finished as we sort out some data grouping issues around financial and non-financial tractions. Weâ€™ve also discussed with the Finance team how the data model can now be used for other reports that also require a lot of manual effort to generate
We continue working in parallel on the Investment use case data model, hoping to start some visualisations work next week
We also did a quick demo at Digital Tuesdays meeting. In case you want to check it out, here is the link: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/9dc11557-b00b-4e42-99cd-53e220759407</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="management-information-mi-suite---release-1--chris-nicholson">Management Information (MI Suite - Release 1) â€“ Chris Nicholson</h3>

<p>Development continues for building the Power BI report for KPI 8 (Low Medium Volume Builders)
System Testing is in progress for KPI 4 (Share of funding to the top 50% of LAs by the price earnings ratio) Some issues with the data means that testing will roll into next week
Analysis work is nearing completion for KPI 9 (MMC reporting). Development work wonâ€™t start on this until there has been agreement on when the remainder of the reports are to be developed and how they will be governed (Release 2) The changes to PCS through Product Support will be delayed now until April due to the Digital project pause</p>

<p>Currently working with Procurement and Legal to finalise how to approach the formal procurement phase fairly in accordance with G-Cloud terms. To meet with Legal on 26/03 to discuss the next steps for reviewing the contracts
Attended a demonstration with One Trust looking at the new Redaction module which might form part of the requirements

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="cloud-hosting-service--ben-patterson">Cloud Hosting Service â€“ Ben Patterson</h3>

<p>This weekâ€¦ the continuation of Sprint 13 and the stories in it, focusing on multi-customer support readiness
The team held a second engagement meeting with Common Components to refine and capture the needs they have
The team continue good technical progress in the sprint plan and stories
We continued analysis/research of the Common Components service needs and fit with CHS IaC product, and discovered there are some areas of ambiguity, semantics, hierarchy, environment specifications and definitions are being explored and defined together
The team created some code samples for user guidance - https://dev.azure.com/homesengland/Cloud Hosting Service/_git/chs-onboarding-code-examples
We also produced some CHS Standards and Patterns - https://dev.azure.com/homesengland/Cloud Hosting Service/_wiki/wikis/Cloud-Hosting-Service.wiki/2714/CHS-Standards-and-Patterns
The Service Now process is being setup and a demo and iteration should be ready sometime in the next sprint</p>

<p>An iterative approach towards the â€˜To Beâ€™ Service Team model makes sense and greatly reduces risks around people, processes and systems knowledge
Day 1 systems for the first Service Team (Inv-Grants &amp; Loans; MHCLG) should include BSF, Monitor, IRS and PSCRF.  The remaining systems (Target, Partner Portal, Bids, DRAM) should be transitioned over time
Product Support should initially remain â€˜As Isâ€™ except for the systems listed above, with other systems being gradually transitioned to other Service Teams to reach the â€˜To Beâ€™ model over time
Due to activities required for Day 1, the first Sprint for the new team should commence on Mon April 19th
The next proposed Service Team (Investments-HtB and Affordable Housing) could feasibly commence fairly soon after the initial team is set-up
A weekly catch-up between DMs and PMs for the Service Teams will occur on a weekly basis to monitor progress and flag issues/risks as activities are carried out to enable the initial team</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="e-learning-tool-beta--al-rawling">E-learning tool (Beta) â€“ Al Rawling</h3>

Discussion to be held with RSH around data inconsistencies, as RSH require some ad-hoc Health and Safety relating training to be sent
Retrospective scheduled for 2nd week in April to cover lessons learnt</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="product-support---alycia-and-rob">Product Support - Alycia and Rob</h3>

<p>With all the work revolving around year end its full on, so some quick notes from PS</p>

<p>The team have pulled together 2 IMS hotfixes (one on Monday, one on 25/03) covering 10+ P1 payment issues
Theyâ€™ve been getting NROSH over the line so that we can release the new yearâ€™s system (main release starts on 25/03 at 6pm)
Weâ€™ve made sure weâ€™ve done dry runs on PCS and are making sure that the team are up to speed with the process should they need to do it in an emergency for EOY/SOY
Scheduling and pulling together a hotfix to eFin interface (again being released 25/03)
Weâ€™ve had to manage and carry out handovers from one BA to another
On top of Service Teams work, adhoc AzureDevOps work/support and supporting Robert T and Simon M during a review for an ISO Audit, we finally got the esausive accounts extended and all BPSS checks done following the contract renewal</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="hr-performance-management---alycia-and-al">HR Performance Management - Alycia and Al</h3>

<p>Jez has hit the ground running and is aiming for the DPIA to be completed early next week to go to DPO for approval, to then commence with contract (weâ€™ve found there to be a lack of examples of anyone completing a full DPIA, which would have been useful and some queries around the process to be able to proceed with a contract when DPIA was recommended but not mandatory)
Continued discussions and configuration options for day 1 (MVP) and invites have gone out for further user research for line manager/colleague pairings
Beta (implementation) will commence once the contract has been signed and the DPIA is completed and approved
Working through our Pilot approach and go/no-go criteria
Consideration for support requirements from day one (2-pronged approach - tech support/new process support)</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="common-components---andrew-godleman">Common Components - Andrew Godleman</h3>
